# Microcks Deployment Guides  

> **ðŸš€ Community-Driven Deployment Effort**  
> This section is maintained by **community contributors**, not the core Microcks maintainers.  
> These guides aim to provide best practices for deploying Microcks on various cloud providers.  

## Overview  

Deploy **Microcks**, the **cloud-native API and microservices mocking and testing tool**, seamlessly on any cloud platform.  
Microcks integrates effortlessly with your existing cloud-native ecosystem, enabling you to simulate, test, and validate APIs in production-like environments.  

Microcks is compatible with **managed Kubernetes services** such as:  

- **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)**  
- **Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)**  
- **Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)**  
- **Other platforms**: OVH, Oracle Cloud, Scaleway, etc.  

This guide is part of a **collaborative community effort** to document deployment strategies for different cloud providers.  
If your preferred platform is not listed or lacks detailed instructions, feel free to **contribute** or **open an issue** in the [Microcks Community Repository](https://github.com/microcks/community).
