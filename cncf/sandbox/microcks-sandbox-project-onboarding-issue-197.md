@amye can you confirm it is what you are expecting on this task?


- lukaszgryglicki:

DevStats [instance](https://microcks.devstats.cncf.io) added. Also added in [All CNCF projects health](https://all.devstats.cncf.io/d/53/projects-health-table?orgId=1) instance. Will be fully-added to all other [All CNCF](https://all.devstats.cncf.io) dashboards on Friday (affiliations research started today, and will be imported as it progresses).

Hi,
We are happy to finalize our onboarding sandbox process.

As:
"Domain: transfer domain to the CNCF" is done
"Website: Analytics transferred" is done
"OpenSSF Best Practices Badge: Start on an OpenSSF Best Practices Badge" reached 91%, so guess it is done. See: https://www.bestpractices.dev/en/projects/7513

For:
"Trademarks: transfer any trademark and logo mark assets over to the LF"
Microcks' logo and trademark is owned by the community. Could you please send the [maintainers](https://github.com/microcks/microcks/blob/master/MAINTAINERS.md) a non-corporate and non-registered agreement?
Maintainers emails available to sign are:
[laurent@microcks.io](mailto:laurent@microcks.io)
[yacine@microcks.io](mailto:yacine@microcks.io)

Regarding "Understand the license allowlist", we have removed some dependencies and will update this accordingly asap.

I am looking forward to seeing who will do or help us with "Things that the CNCF will do or help the project to do:"

I appreciate your support.
Regards,
Yacine

- amye:

Question: 
Your application has a different company as contributing -- I see https://postman.com/. Should someone from that group sign? 

- yada:

Only the two maintainers have to sign. 

- yada:

Hi,
Can we close "Trademarks: transfer any trademark and logo mark assets over to the LF"? 
We are just waiting to sign on our side. Reminder:
- non-corporate and non-registered agreement
- Maintainers emails available to sign are:
laurent@microcks.io
yacine@microcks.io

Thanks 

- amye:

Not sure what this means? We have two agreements, non-registered and registered trademarks, but your application has a contributing company associated with it.

- yada:

In our submission we have added Postman to the "Contributing or Sponsoring Org" as their are sponsoring Microcks. But they do not need to sign as the project is owned by the two maintainers. Which explain why they do not need to sign from our point fo view, let me know if I missed anything ?

Happy New Year, and all the best for 2024 🎉
https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7150492809869926400

 🪄 As our New Year's Resolutions and wish, let's finish this sandbox onboarding process this Q1 🙌
 
 Only **7 tasks to close**, and we are done: 
 @amye @Cmierly @caniszczyk and the team, let me know if anything is missing on our side, and we will process it accordingly.
 
 From the project point of view:

1.  " Trademarks: transfer any trademark and logo mark assets over to the LF"
Maintainers (laurent@microcks.io & yacine@microcks.io) are waiting for the non-corporate and non-registered agreement and will sign it immediately. As the thread above explains, maintainers are the only ones who need to sign. 

2. "Insights: add to LFX Insights"
✅ See: https://insights.lfx.linuxfoundation.org/foundation/cncf/overview?project=microcks

3. "Events: update CFP + Registration + CFP Area forms"
What do you expect from us on this point? Any link/info will be appreciated.

4. "ServiceDesk: confirm maintainers have read https://www.cncf.io/services-for-projects/"
✅ confirmed.

5. "CNCF Welcome Email Sent to confirm maintainer list access"
✅ Received: [cncf-microcks-maintainers] Welcome to cncf-microcks-maintainers@lists.cncf.io
Group Notification <cncf-microcks-maintainers+owner@lists.cncf.io>
Fri, Jun 30, 2023, 12:18 PM

6. "Book time with the team with http://project-meetings.cncf.io"
✅ booked and meeting done on November 7th, 2023 (during KubeCon + CloudNativeCon North America) with Jake Pineda.

7. "Adopt a license scanning tool, like FOSSA or Snyk"
Can we have some help setting it up and accessing the license via CNCF agreements?

 Thank you
 Yacine
