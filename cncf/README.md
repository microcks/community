# CNCF

This directory is dedicated to sharing **CNCF-related activities, materials, and resources** for the Microcks project.

## Purpose

The main goal is to more broadly share with the community the work that the maintainers have created or are currently working on in the context of the **Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF)**. This includes efforts to align Microcks with CNCF expectations, processes, and best practices.

## What you will find here

This directory aims to:

- Make visible some of the background work done by maintainers related to CNCF engagement.
- Centralize documents and resources useful for adopters and contributors (for example: submissions, reviews, guidelines, references).
- Provide a welcoming place for community members to contribute ideas, feedback, and improvements.
- Enable collaborative maintenance of resources to keep them accurate and up to date.
- Support the creation of new shared resources when needed.

## Community-driven

The intent is to keep this content **open, transparent, and community-driven**.  
Contributions, suggestions, and feedback are welcome and encouraged.
