# Current Security Challenges with Microcks Mock Endpoints

Microcks is a powerful API mocking and testing tool that dynamically creates mock endpoints based on your API specifications (OpenAPI, AsyncAPI, Postman Collections, etc.). However, the current implementation has some limitations regarding security and authentication:

### How Microcks Mock Endpoints Work Currently

1. **Endpoint Generation**: Microcks automatically generates mock endpoints based on imported API definitions.
   - REST APIs are exposed at `/rest/{service-name}/{version}/{resource-path}`
   - SOAP services are exposed at `/soap/{service-name}/{version}`
   - GraphQL APIs are exposed at `/graphql/{service-name}/{version}`
   - Async/Event APIs are exposed via dedicated message brokers

2. **Default Access Control**: By default, all mock endpoints are publicly accessible with no authentication required.
   - Anyone with network access to the Microcks server can call these endpoints
   - No built-in rate limiting or throttling mechanism exists at the mock endpoint level
   - No user-specific access controls for individual mock services

3. **Microcks Admin Security**: While the Microcks admin interface can be secured using Keycloak/OAuth, this security doesn't extend to the generated mock endpoints.

## Current Workarounds

Currently, users secure Microcks mock endpoints through these approaches:

1. **Network-level Security**: 
   - Placing Microcks behind a VPN
   - Using network security groups to restrict access
   - Implementing IP-based access controls

2. **Manual API Gateway Configuration**: 
   - Manually configuring routes in API gateways to proxy and secure Microcks endpoints
   - Creating custom policies for each mock service
   - Managing separate authentication systems

3. **Kubernetes/Service Mesh Solutions**:
   - Using Istio, Linkerd, or similar tools to enforce policies
   - Creating custom ingress rules with security policies


## Specific Requirements for API Gateway Integration

An ideal API gateway integration with Microcks should:

1. Route requests correctly to the appropriate Microcks mock endpoints
2. Preserve path parameters, query strings, and headers needed by Microcks for matching responses
3. Support authentication while not interfering with Microcks' request matching logic
4. Allow for easy updates when new mock services are created in Microcks
5. Maintain performance with minimal added latency
